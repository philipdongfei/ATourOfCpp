# 10 Algorithms

## 10.1 Introduction

  the standard library provides the most common algorithms for containers in addition to providing the most common container types.

## 10.2 Use of Iterators

  a few iterators referring to useful elements can be obtained; **begin()** and **end()** are the best examples of this.

## 10.3 Iterator Types

  Any particular iterator is an object of some type. There are, however, many different iterator types, because an iterator needs to hold the information necessary for doing its job for a particular container type. These iterator types can be as different as the containers and the specialized needs they serve.

## 10.4 Stream Iterators

  Iterators are a general and useful concept for dealing with sequences of elements in containers. containers are not the only place where we find sequences of elements.

## 10.6 Algorithm Overview

  A general definition of an algorithm is "a finite set of rules which gives a sequence of operations for solving a specific set of problems[and] has five important features: Finiteness ... Definiteness ... Input ... Output ... Effectiveness"[Knuth,1968,1.1].

  The standard-library algorithms tend to be more carefully designed, specified, and implemented than the average hand-crafted loop, so know them and use them in preference to code written in the bare language.
